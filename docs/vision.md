 # **Project Title:** _Sink Ships_

## **Type:** _Command-Line_ Battleship Game


#### Overview:
Sink Ships is a command-line version of the classic Battleship game, developed as an obligatory project for the Developer Testing course. This project is a hands-on application of Test-Driven Development (TDD) methods, undertaken by us, to demonstrate our understanding and skills in TDD within a practical setting.

#### Vision:
Our vision with Sink Ships is to create a command-line Battleship type game. The project is not just about building a game; it's about showcasing how TDD can be integrated into the software development lifecycle, resulting in a robust and functional application. Our aim is to develop a game that we can be proud of.

#### Key Features:

  **Simple Command-Line Interface:** The game will be text-based, focusing on functionality and ease of interaction, avoiding the complexities of graphical user interfaces.
    **Battleship Game Mechanics:** Adhering to the traditional rules of the Battleship game, it will offer a familiar yet engaging gameplay experience.
  **TDD-Driven Development:** The entire development process will be guided by TDD principles. We will write tests before any functional code, ensuring that every aspect of the game is thoroughly tested and validated.
  **Modular Code Design:** Our goal is to architect the code in a modular manner, leveraging the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture. This approach not only simplifies testing and maintenance but also ensures a clear separation of concerns, enhancing the overall code organization and scalability.
  **Collaborative Development Approach:** The project will be a collaborative effort, allowing us to learn from each other and tackle various development and testing challenges together.

#### Project Goals:

  To apply TDD methods effectively in a real-world software development scenario.
  To gain practical experience in writing and managing tests, including unit and integration tests.
  To develop a clean, efficient, and maintainable codebase.
  To collaborate effectively as a team, enhancing our problem-solving and software development skills.

#### Target Audience:
This project is an integral part of our coursework in the Developer Testing course, aimed at demonstrating our proficiency in TDD and software development.

#### Outcome:
Upon completion, Sink Ships will be a testament to our learning and application of TDD. It will serve as a practical example of how TDD can be employed in developing a reliable and engaging command-line game, reflecting our growth and capabilities as budding software developers.
