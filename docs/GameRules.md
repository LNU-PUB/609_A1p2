<h1><center>Rules for Sink Ships</center></h1>
<p><center>Based on BattleShip a Hasbro, Inc. game</center></p>


## Game Objective

The object of Sink Ships is to try and sink all of the computer's ships before it sink all of yours. You try and hit them by typing in the coordinates of one of the squares on the board.  The computer player also tries to hit your ships by displaying the coordinates.  Neither you nor the computer player can see the other's board so you must try to guess where they are.  After each round the hits, shots and scores are displayed.

## Starting a New Game

Each player places the 5 ships somewhere on their board.  The ships can only be placed vertically or horizontally. Diagonal placement is not allowed. No part of a ship may hang off the edge of the board.  Ships may not overlap each other.  No ships may be placed on another ship. 

Once the guessing begins, the players may not move the ships.

The 5 ships are:  Aircraft Carrier [A] (occupies 5 spaces), Battleship [B] (4), Cruiser [C] (3), Submarine [S] (3), and Destroyer [D] (2).

## Playing the Game

Player and computer player take turns guessing by typing in the coordinates. Then a response is given with "hit" or "miss" as appropriate. THe software keeps track of hits and misses from both players and displays them after each round.

When all of the squares that one of your ships occupies have been hit, the ship will be sunk. It will be announce as "hit and sunk". As soon as all of one player's ships have been sunk, the game ends.
