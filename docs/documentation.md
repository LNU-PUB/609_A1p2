## Initial Planning
We began by discussing Joakim's idea of creating a game similar to the classic Battleship board game. 

Our decision was to develop a CLI (Command Line Interface) application, with the primary objective being to learn and utilize Test-Driven Development (TDD). Our initial steps included planning the domain and choosing the MVC (Model-View-Controller) model as our architectural framework. 

Subsequently, we developed the initial class diagram, as depicted in [Diagram 1](#diagram-1). In addition, we wrote the [Vision Statement](./vision.md) and formulated the [Game Rules](./GameRules.md), drawing inspiration from the rules of the Battleship game. Following this, we compiled the [Software Requirements Specification (SRS)](./SRS.md) and began drafting the [User Manual](./UserManual.md), which is currently in its preliminary stages.
